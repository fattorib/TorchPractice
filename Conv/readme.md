# Intel Image Classification

The Intel Image Classification dataset consists of images of the natural world. The images are broken into 6 categories: Buildings, Forests, Glaciers, Mountains, Seas, and Streets. Here, I design and implement a basic CNN that can acheive over 80% accuracy on the test data.

## Data
We are given three datasets: Train, Test, and Predict. Train/Test are labelled and (unsurprisingly) Predict is not. All images given as 150 x 150 RGB. Here is a selection of the images from Train: ![text](https://github.com/fattorib/TorchPractice/blob/master/Conv/images/Classes.png)

As you can see there are a very wide range of images to train on!
